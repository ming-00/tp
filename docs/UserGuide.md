## **1. About BookCoin**
BookCoin (to the Moon) is a **desktop app for managing bookings that presents users with a structured and detailed information on facility availability via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). BookCoin is designed for administrative personnels of schools or organisations who need to manage bookings across a large number of facilities. If you can type fast, BookCoin can get your facility management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Enjoy!


## **2. Quick start**

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `bookingapp.jar` [here](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W17-3/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder that you want to use as the _home folder_ for BookCoin.

1. Run `java -jar bookingapp.jar via your terminal` (preferred). As a second alternative, double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. <br>

   ![Ui](images/Ui_Booking_1.3.png) <br><br>
   Note how the app contains some sample data. This is for you to test out the commands first, and you may delete them using the `clear` command when you are ready to use the app for your own purposes. <br>


1. Type the command in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`list_venue`** : Lists all venues.

   * **`add_venue v/Chua Thian Poh Hall`** : Starts a multi-step command to create a venue named `Chua Thian Poh Hall`. Fill in the prompts as directed.

   * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#3-features) below for details of each command.

**:information_source: Using BookCoin:**<br>

This section gives an overview of BookCoinâ€™s layout so that you can get started quickly.

**There are four main segments in BookCoin:**
* Tabs that allow you to navigate between Persons, Venues and Bookings

* A command box as well as a result display box at the top left of the application

* A bookmark list on the left of the screen

* A main viewing area that would display complete information about a person, venue or booking

</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **3. Features**

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `find_venue v/VENUE_NAME`, `VENUE_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `find_venue v/Victoria Hall`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `add_venue v/VENUE_NAME [max/MAXIMUM_OCCUPANCY]` can be used as `v/Chua Thian Poh Hall max/40` or as `v/Chua Thian Poh Hall`.
* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `exit 123`, it will be interpreted as `exit`.
  
* Limitations: certain keywords are reserved for commands and hence should not be used in your regular input field. For example, you would not be able to set a venue description to "n/a" because `n/` is a reserved keyword.

</div>

### 3.1. General features and commands

#### 3.1.1. Viewing all available commands : `help`

Displays the link to the user guide.

Format: `help`

#### 3.1.2. Deletes all records : `clear`

Format: `clear`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Warning about clear command:**<br>

* The clear command is especially useful for first time users because the app would first launch with sample data for new users
  to have greater convenience when testing app functionalities. Users can then use the clear command to
  clear the database of sample data after familiarising themselves with the app.
  
* Be careful when using this command! All data will be deleted permanently.
  
</div>

#### 3.1.3. Saving data

### 3.2. Command specific to multi-step commands

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: More information about multi-step commands:**<br>

* Some operations require several input fields, which can be very tedious to type in one go and may be difficult to remember.
Multi-step commands therefore allow such commands to be used with greater ease as the system will prompt you to input items one at a time. To skip input for optional fields, you can just press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key without typing anything when prompted to enter an optional field.
* The multi-step commands currently supported in v1.4 are `add_person`, `add_venue` and `add_booking`.
* The commands listed in this section are specific to multi-step commands and are only applicable for use when you are in the middle of a multi-step command.

</div>

#### 3.2.1. Exiting prompting : `exit_prompt`

Exits the multi-step prompting for multi-step commands. After exiting prompting, you would be able to give command
inputs again. Other commands would not work if you do not exit the multi-step command.

Format: `exit_prompt`

### 3.3. Person

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: About persons:**<br>

* BookCoin stores information about venue bookers which is important for scheduling/ contacting purposes. When bookers are stored, their information can be used for multiple bookings in the future which allows you to access their details easily without having to repeat the same booker details multiple times across bookings.
* For your convenience, we use the term "person" in the app instead of "booker" to make a distinction between "booker" and "booking", which can be confusing.
* Persons are identified by their emails, hence all email inputs between persons must be unique. Phone inputs must also be unique between persons, but persons with the same name are allowed.

</div>

#### 3.3.1. Adding a person : `add_person` (Multi step command)

Adds a new person for the booking app. `add_person` is a multi-step command that will prompt you for additional input. Inputting 
`add_person n/NAME` will start the command.
The app will guide you through the command through prompts for each field. As with other multi step commands, you can exit the command by entering `exit_prompt` at any point. Optional fields can be skipped by pressing the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key when you are prompted to input an optional field.

After keying a valid initial input, the multi-step prompting will prompt you to enter details for the following fields in the specified order:
* Email: must be unique and of the format <em>local-part@domain</em>.
* Phone number: must be unique and input as digits without spaces in between. The permitted length is 7-15 digits inclusive, which is the standard length of all international phone numbers.
* Tags: tags should be alphanumeric without spaces. To add multiple tags, tags should be separated by commas. No tag can be empty, so consecutive commas without any tag in between would be invalid.

### 3.4. Venue

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: About venues:**<br>
